            This is my second year here at CU Boulder, and I am absolutely excited to start this journey into this new major.

            I have passions about music, therefore I am involved in the University Choir through the College of Music, as well as composing my own music.

            I have been practicing Sound Design through film. I have been working with Alex Little of Autumn Mountain Productions on my first sound project, "Alex-Point". (Linked below.)
